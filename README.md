# Crop Recommendation System

![Crop Recommendation](https://www.day1tech.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Image-Crop-Recommendation@1x-1.png)

## Overview
This project is a **Crop Recommendation System** that uses **Machine Learning** to suggest the best crop based on soil and environmental conditions. It helps farmers optimize yield and improve decision-making.

## Features
- Predicts the most suitable crop based on soil parameters
- Uses **Supervised Machine Learning** techniques
- Provides insights using **data visualization**
- Supports various soil and climate conditions

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-Learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/crop-recommendation.git
   cd crop-recommendation
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
   ```

## Usage
Run the script to start the recommendation system:
```bash
python crop_recommendation.py
```
- Enter soil and climate details to get crop recommendations.
- View graphical insights from the dataset.

## How It Works
1. Takes input features like **Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium (NPK), temperature, humidity, pH, and rainfall**.
2. Predicts the best crop using **Machine Learning models**.
3. Displays the recommendation and insights.

## Future Improvements
- Enhance model accuracy with deep learning techniques
- Integrate real-time weather API for dynamic recommendations
- Deploy as a mobile application
